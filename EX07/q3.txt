Explenation:

- Used the second alternate from rec7.
- Used the skeleton from rec7, slide 8.
- Preformed ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, pid, addr_check_if_virus, addr_check_if_virus_alternative):
  copy addr_check_if_virus_alternative to the address addr in the tracees memory, when addr is
  the GOT address of check_if_virus (replaced in the python file, also the address of the alternate 
  taken from addresses.py).
- replaced the pid, check_if_virus_code address, addr_check_if_virus_alternative in the python file to the right values.
