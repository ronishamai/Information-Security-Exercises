# How I extracted the process ID:

The payload is a shell script that first specifies that the shell to be used is `/bin/sh` (with a shabang).
Then, executes the `pgrep` command with the argument `-f antivirus`. 
The pgrep command searches for a process with with the given name ('antivirus'), and returns it`s process ID (PID).

# The command to kill the antivirus:

Same as before, the payload is a shell script that first specifies that the shell to be used is `/bin/sh`. 
The command to kill the antivirus is 'kill -15' (when -15 is the default value). The 'kill' instruction parameter 
is the pid of the process to be killed - the antivirus pid.
