 # How I found the address to override:
 
 gdb ./antivirus -> break main -> run -> print check_if_virus_code
 
 # Explenation:
 
- Took the template from Rec7, Slide8.
- Checked the opcode in little endian of 'XOR EAX, EAX; RET;' - a function that always returns 0.
- Preformed ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, pid, addr, xor_eax_eax_ret_nop): copy the word xor_eax_eax_ret_nop 
  to the address addr in the tracees memory, when addr is the address of check_if_virus_code (replaced
   in the python file), and xor_eax_eax_ret_nop is the opcode we created for 'XOR EAX, EAX; RET;'.
- replaced the pid, check_if_virus_code address in the python file to the right values.
