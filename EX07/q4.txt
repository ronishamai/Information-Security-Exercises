Read system call details, taken from: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_system_calls.htm.

In a while loop that checks if the process has not exited normally, we do:
ptrace with PTRACE_SYSCALL, then gets the registers by ptrace with PTRACE_GETREGS into user_regs_struct struct, 
then checks for read syscall that can be identify be eax = 3, and in case of read sys call - change edx register 
which contains the length to 0 by ptrace with 

PTRACE_SETREGS on our register struct.

The rest of the code is the same as q2, q3.
