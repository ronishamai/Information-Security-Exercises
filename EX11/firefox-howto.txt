1. Open firefox
2. In the address bar, type "about:config" (without the quotes) and click Enter
3. Click OK on the big scary warning
4. Search for `network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault` and set it to false
5. Search for `network.cookie.sameSite.noneRequiresSecure` and set it to false (it might be false already, that is fine)
