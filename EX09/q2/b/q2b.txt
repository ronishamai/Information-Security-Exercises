I used the example given at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-and-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256.

- Using PyCrypto as we required to do.
- The Origin msg: "I love you".
- Block length: 16, because AES data size must be a multiple of 16.
- Used PKCS7 padding, according to the link you put in the assignment description.
- Key: i chose - 'This is Julias and Winstons key', sha256 (hashlib).
- The key length, mode, IV and other parameters - according to the above example above.
