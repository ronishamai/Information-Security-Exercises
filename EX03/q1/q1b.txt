We will choose that the data of the message will be an array of bytes ("bytearray"), which will be exactly like the original array but in the case where the second byte is incorrect (the XOR byte) - we can change this byte only, instead of leaving it incorrect. We will notice that we did not change the message at all - but only the array type, and the second byte if it is not correct.
