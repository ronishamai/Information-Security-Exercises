- I changed the instruction: mov eax,1 in the part of invalid msg (the rerurn value)/
- The changes I made in defining the command, were made according to:
    1. the mov instruction opcodes.
    2. the constatn 0 representation.
- In practice - what I wanted to do is always to mov to eax that stores the return value the value 0.
- I padded with nops in order to get the same code length of the program and the patched.
- I returned the patched after all the changes.
* notice that the mov here is a 5 bytes instructions, when in q1d the instructions where 2 bytes.
