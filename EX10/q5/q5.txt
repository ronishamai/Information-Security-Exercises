Explanation:

For the verify action with the correct command and signature, as first we:

1. create a JSON file with the initial command and signature.
2. start a subprocess and execute "run.py" with the above file as an argument.

Now, after the verify action, we stop the subprocess to change the command the subprocess will execute 
(i chose 0.1 by time.time() and checking how many time the verifing takes, while we need the execution won`t start in this point of time):

3. stop the subprocess ("run.py") executaion for 0.1 seconds.
4. replace the file`s content with "echo hacked".

Finish by:

5. wait for the subprocess execution to finish.
