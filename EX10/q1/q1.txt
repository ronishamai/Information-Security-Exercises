The vulnerability:

In the function validate_script in run.py, as first we open & read the data in the given path, and then we do: data = eval(data).
The eval() function is used to evaluate the string as code.
So, we can exploit this and instead of sending "valid" username, password etc. to send a code (command) which prints 'hacked', and a code which exit the program.
Because of eval(), there will be an execution of the given code, and the authentication test won`t take place.
