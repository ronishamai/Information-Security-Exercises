In "https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html", There is the warning:
Warning The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. 
Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.

Then, I read in: "https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/", about Pickle exploits. 
I found an example, under "Creating the exploit" and changed it with the wanted commands.

Explanation:

We called our class ECHO_HACKED and let its __reduce__ method return a tuple of a callable and a tuple of arguments. 
Our callable is os.system and the argument a shell code that prints 'hacked'.

We did the same with EXIT class, when our callable here is sys.exit.

Then, instead of sending valid username & password, I sent ECHO_HACKED() and EXIT()!
