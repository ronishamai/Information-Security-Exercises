Q3:

THE KEY IDEA OF WHAT THE GIVEN CODE DOES:
The code copies a string, byte by byte, using a loop, from ESI register to EDI register. 


IF MORE DETAIL IS REQUIRED:
The code starts coping the string to the EDI register, when it reach to zero in the memory (moving forward EDI in memory by loop, until pointing on
zero).

Then, it start with a loop that responsible for coping the string: the AL register is used as a temporary store when transferring the current char
in memory from ESI to EDI, advansing the registers to the next place in memory, and finishing when we reach to zero.
